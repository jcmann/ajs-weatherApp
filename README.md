# ajs-weatherApp

This project was written for an Advanced Javascript course at Madison College. Our assignment required us to use the Geonames API, which unfortunately only serves over HTTP on its free tier. Because GitHub pages uses HTTPS, the API requests do not actually work on the current GitHub pages version of this app. Eventually I'd love to revisit this project with a secure API! 

In testing it appeared that whatever weather service was being used may cease making wind directional measurements after a certain time of day.

In the meantime, here's what the app looks like with results:

![Search results for the temperature and wind in Beverly Hills. It is 50 degrees F with no wind in a Northerly direction.](https://github.com/jcmann/ajs-weatherApp/blob/main/images/no-icons-screenshot.png)

![Search results for Juneau, Alaska. It is 33 degrees and also not windy.](https://github.com/jcmann/ajs-weatherApp/blob/main/images/one-icon-screenshot.png)
