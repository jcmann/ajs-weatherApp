# ajs-weatherApp

This project was originally an assigment for Advanced JS at Madison College. Originally, we had to use the free GeoNames API. Unfortunately this free API uses HTTP for its requests, so this app wouldn't work when deployed on GitHub pages. After turning it in for a grade I refactored it to use OpenWeather API so it would be functional hosted somewhere. 

You can use the app [here on GitHub Pages](https://jcmann.github.io/ajs-weatherApp/).
